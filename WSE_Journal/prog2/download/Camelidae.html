	  <TD class="subfam">Modern day camelids are the only living representatives of the suborder Tylopoda
	(from the Greek words <I>tylo</I>, meaning callous, and <I>pous</I>, genitive
	<I>podos,</I> meaning foot). The four Recent species are well adapted to
	arid environments. A unique wide pad of connective tissue on the base of
	the feet provides support on soft, sandy soils. The fossil record of this
	subfamily begins in the mid-Eocene deposits of North America (the center
	of camelid evolution). The camels radiated out from North America to Eurasia
	in the Pliocene, and to South America during the Pleistocene, disappearing
	from North America around 10,000 years ago.
	<P>
	The feet of modern camels seemingly defy the definition of "ungulate": the
	two digits in the feet (III and IV) sit almost flat on the ground (i.e.,
	are digitigrade) as part of a wide pad. Instead of hooves, the distal phalanges
	bear nails on their upper surface. Nevertheless, the fossil record distinctly
	shows that camels are ungulates: fossilized camels from the Oligocene have
	the same two-digit foot structure, but were nearly unguligrade and likely
	had true hooves. These early camels display one of the characteristic features
	of Tylopods: the metapodials (foot bones) are fused to form a cannon bone,
	but the distal ends separate and flare outward, forming a "Y" of bone (the
	arms of the "Y" lead to the two digits). A general climatic shift to more
	arid conditions occurred in the Miocene, and was coupled with a secondary
	development of a digitigrade foot posture. All camelids since the Pliocene
	have been digitigrade.
	<P>
	The position of this family within the order Artiodactyla was formerly
	confounded by the fact that camelids ruminate (regurgitate and rechew their
	food) - at was thus assumed that they were more closely related to the ruminants
	than the Suiformes. However, molecular evidence suggests that this feature
	evolved independently from the <A HREF="Ruminantia.html">Ruminantia</A>;
	the stomach of the Camelidae is only three-chambered. All members of this
	family are renowned for "spitting" when upset, although it is actually stomach
	contents which are ejected at annoying objects.
	<P>
	The upper lip of all members of the Camelidae is split into two finger-like
	projections which aid in the collection of tough forage. The dental formula
	is I 1/3, C 1/1, P 2-3/1-2, M 3/3 x 2 = 30-34. There is no gall bladder.
	Unique among mammals, the red blood cells of the Camelidae are oval in shape.
	There is no connective skin between the hind legs and the belly, increasing
	the apparent length of the hind legs. Camelids walk with a "pacing" gait,
	where both the front and hind legs on one side of the body are moved forward
	together. The result is that the body weight is shifted from one side to
	the other, creating a rocking motion - camels are thus often called "ships
	of the desert".
	<P>
	All four species of recent camels have been domesticated. The two domestic
	forms from South America (the llama and alpaca) were formerly considered
	as species in their own right; today, they are lumped together with their
	wild counterparts (the guanaco and vicu&ntilde;a, respectively). While domestic
	camelids are found in large numbers, the wild species are all listed on the
	IUCN's Red List. Indeed, the dromedary or Arabian camel (<I>Camelus
	dromedarius</I>), is now extinct in the wild (although feral populations
	exist, notably in Australia).
