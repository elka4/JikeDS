	  <TD class="subfam">The Bovidae are the most diverse group of living ungulates with 143 Recent
	species (over 55% of modern ungulates). Bovids are primarily Old World in
	their distribution, although a few species are found in North America. The
	name "antelope" is often used to describe many members of this family, but
	it is not a definable, taxonomically-based term - if it's not an ox, goat,
	or sheep, then it's an antelope; <I>antelope</I> are found in all eight modern
	bovid subfamilies alongside distinctly non-antilopine species.
	<P>
	The present classification scheme for bovids recognizes eight subfamilies
	subdivided into two clades, the Boodontia (with a single subfamily, Bovinae)
	and Aegodontia (composed of all other bovid subfamilies). Some authors do
	not recognize these two clades, instead reducing the number of subfamilies
	to two: Bovinae (without change) and Antilopinae (with all of the Aegodontid
	subfamilies as tribes within it). Among the eight subfamilies presented here,
	the phylogeny of some groups is well-established (e.g., the Bovinae are
	monophyletic and basal; the Caprinae, Hippotraginae, and Alcelaphinae cluster
	together consistently), while the interrelationships of the other subfamilies
	are still under question.
	<P>
	The family Bovidae began its evolution in Africa around 19 million years
	ago, and rapidly diversified, with 78 genera known from the Miocene (compared
	to 50 today). Kingdon (1997) suggests that a continental divide between Africa
	and Eurasia may be responsible for the early divergence of the Boodontia
	(Eurasian in origin) and the Aegodontia (which continued evolving in Africa).
	The rejoining of the two continental land masses (after these two principal
	clades had become distinct) at the Arabian peninsula removed this geographic
	barrier, allowing both groups to expand into the other's homeland.
	<P>
	Today, Africa remains the heart of bovid diversity (representatives of all
	eight modern families inhabit the continent, and four of these families are
	found nowhere else). Three bovid subfamilies (Bovinae, Caprinae, and Antilopinae)
	are well-represented in Eurasia (while a fourth subfamily, the African
	Hippotraginae, has a single representative on the Arabian peninsula). The
	Americas, in comparison, have very few bovids (only five bovid species are
	native to the Nearctic region, and no bovids are found in the Neotropics).
	The bovid invasion of North America is relatively recent: the Bering Land
	Bridge connected Russia and Alaska during the Pleistocene and its northern
	climate prevented all but the most cold-tolerant species from crossing to
	North America.
	<P>
	One of the defining characteristics of this family is the presence of unbranched
	horns. Horns are present in males of all bovid species and in females of
	some genera (most frequently in large species where adult females weigh over
	40 kg). When horns are present in both sexes, those of males are always thicker
	at the base and more complex. The horns are permanently attached to the frontal
	bones of the skull, and are composed of a bone core covered with a keratin
	sheath (which is never shed). An air space separates these two layers, with
	the result that bovids are often called "hollow-horned ungulates".
	<I>Tetracerus</I> is unique among wild bovids in that males regularly bear
	four horns (two pairs); all other genera (with the exception of some domestic
	sheep) have only one pair. Bovids have the typical dentition of the ruminants
	- I 0/3, C 0/1, P 3/3, M 3/3 x 2 = 32. The upper canines are always absent.
	A single lacrimal canal is usually present in the orbits of the skull.
