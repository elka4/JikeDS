(from Wikipedia)

<p>
Bears are mammals of the family Ursidae. Bears are classified as 
caniforms, or doglike carnivorans, with the 
<a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring16/CSCI-GA.2580-001/MarineMammal/Pinniped.html">pinnipeds</a> being their 
closest living relatives. Although only eight species of bears are 
extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of 
habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the 
Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North 
America, South America, Europe, and Asia.

Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with 
stocky legs, long snouts, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five 
nonretractile claws, and short tails. While the 
<a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring16/CSCI-GA.2580-001/MarineMammal/PolarBear.html">polar bear</a> is 
mostly carnivorous, and the 
<a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring16/CSCI-GA.2580-001/MarineMammal/GiantPanda.html">giant panda</a> feeds almost entirely on 
bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied 
diets.
