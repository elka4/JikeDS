	    ALT="Order Artiodactyla">The even-toed ungulates are the most successful
	group of large herbivores on earth today, having outpaced the formerly widespread
	perissodactyls in the Oligocene. Artiodactyls are indigenous to every
	zoogeographic region (including several species on Sulawesi and other islands
	in the Australasian region); they are not native to the continents of Antarctica
	and Australia, but many species have been introduced into areas outside of
	their natural range, including Australia, New Guinea, and the islands of
	Oceania. The approximately 240 ungulate members of this order show incredible
	diversity in size, form, dietary preferences, and climatic tolerance. This
	order contains the majority of domesticated mammal species, including cattle,
	reindeer, camels, pigs, goats, and sheep.
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	Recent molecular evidence has radically reorder the classification of this
	order, notably proving that whales and dolphins (Order Cetacea) belong WITHIN
	this order. Some authors have proposed renaming the order "Cetartiodactyla" to reflect the new combination, while other have suggested retaining the two
	orders, but group them in a superorder, also titled the Cetartiodactyla.
	However, the general consensus among the scientific community is to retain the name Artiodactyla (which has priority) for the combined order of even-toed ungulates and cetaceans. Since they don't have hooves, whales and dolphins aren't included in this
	website - but you can check out the <A HREF="links.html#Cetacea">links</A>
	section for some great cetacean websites!
	<P ALIGN=Left>
	There are three well-established suborders:
	<OL>
	  <LI>
	    Tylopoda - camels
	  <LI>
	    Suiformes - pigs and peccaries (and formerly hippos)
	  <LI>
	    <A HREF="Artiodactyla/Ruminantia.html">Ruminantia</A> - the ruminants,
	    containing the majority of modern artiodactyl species<BR>
	    &nbsp;<BR>
	    Like the suggested hybridized name <I>Cetartiodactyla</I>, the close allying of the
	    hippopotamuses and cetaceans has created the need for a new suborder:
	  <LI>
	    Cetancodonta - hippos, dolphins, and whales.

	Evolution
      </H3>
      <DIV class="indent">
	The evolutionary history of the ungulate members of the
	Artiodactyla is relatively well known, since, due to their large bones,
	fossils are plentiful. However, the inclusion of cetaceans - a group with
	a relatively scant fossil history - in this order has caused much debate.
	The first artiodactyl fossils (including the rabbit-sized <I>Diacodexis</I>
	and <I>Protodichobune</I>) appear around 54 million years ago, in the early
	Eocene deposits of North America and Europe. These early even-toed ungulates
	had the full placental complement of low-crowned teeth (44 in total), four
	distinct toes on each foot, and no cranial appendages. Arising at a time
	when perissodactyls dominated the large herbivorous niches, artiodactyls
	remained relatively unspecialized until the Oligocene, when an explosive
	radiation is apparent (primarily in Eurasia). This order has remained abundant
	and diverse since that time (18 extinct families of ungulate artiodactyls
	are known in addition to the ten modern families), while the formerly highly
	successful Perissodactyla have continually declined.
	<P>
	The highly specialized cetaceans are believed to have evolved from the
	Archaeoceti, a group of primitive whales known from fossils as early as 50
	million years ago. The Archaeocetes were formerly thought to have arisen
	from Mesonychian ungulates based on morphological features. However, Mesonychians
	are known from fossil deposits 60 million years old - much earlier than the
	first artiodactyls. While it is now generally agreed that these shared characters
	are convergent, the fossil history of the cetaceans has yet to be fully resolved
	in relation to the evolution of the artiodactyls.
      </DIV>
      <P align="left">
      <H3>
	Diagnostic Characteristics
      </H3>
      <DIV class="indent">
	The primary distinguishing feature of all of the ungulates within this order
	is the paraxonic limb structure, in which the symmetry of the foot passes
	between the two middle digits (III and IV). The first digit (the "thumb"
	or pollex in the hand and the hallux on the hind limb) is absent in all modern
	artiodactyls, with the result that all species possess an even number of
	toes on each foot (with the exception of the Tayassuidae, in which the hind
	foot only has three digits). Two main types of foot structure are recognized:
	a "cloven hoof" with two weight-bearing toes, and a spreading foot with four
	digits. In all cases the third and fourth digits are well developed, while
	the second and fifth are reduced, vestigial, or absent. All ungulate
	artiodactyls have pulley-shaped articulating surfaces on both ends of
	the astragalus (fossil evidence of cetaceans indicates that primitive whales
	also possessed this feature).
	<P align="left">
	The nasal bones in the skulls of the artiodactyls are not expanded caudally,
	nor is there an alisphenoid canal. All species have a postorbital bar. Teeth
	are variable, but the upper incisors are always reduced or absent. Canines
	are usually small or not present at all, although in some species they are
	greatly enlarged into tusks. Two main types of molars are recognized - the
	brachyodont (low-crowned) teeth of the pigs, peccaries, and hippos, and the
	hypsodont (high-crowned) teeth of the camels and some ruminants.
