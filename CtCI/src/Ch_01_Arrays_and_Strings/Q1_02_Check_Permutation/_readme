1.2	Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
Hints: #1, #84, #122, #131

Describe what it means for two strings to be permutations of each other. Now, look at that definition you provided. Can you check the strings against that definition?

1.2	There is one solution that is 0(N log N) time. Another solution uses some space, but is 0(N) time.
1.2 Could a hash table be useful?
1.2	Two strings that are permutations should have the same characters, but in different orders. Can you make the orders the same?
