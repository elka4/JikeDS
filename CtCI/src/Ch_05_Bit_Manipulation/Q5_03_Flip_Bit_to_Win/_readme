5.3	Flip Bit to Win: You have an integer and you can flip exactly one bit from a 0 to a 1. Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of Is you could create.
EXAMPLE
Input:	1775	(or: 11011101111)
Output:	8

Hints: # 159, #226, #314, #352




5.3	Try to do it in linear time, a single pass, and 0( 1) space.

5.3	Start with a brute force solution. Can you try all possibilities?

5.3	Each sequence can be lengthened by merging it with an adjacent sequence (if any) or just flipping the immediate neighboring zero. You just need to find the best choice.

5.3 Flipping a 0 to a 1 can merge two sequences of 1 sâ€”but only if the two sequences are separated by only one 0.
