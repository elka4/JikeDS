5.8	Draw Line: A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (xl, y) to (x2, y).
The method signature should look something like:
drawLine(byte[] screen, int width, int xl, int x2, int y)

Hints: #366, #381, #384, #391


5.8	First try the naive approach. Can you set a particular "pixel"?

5.8	When you're drawing a long line, you'll have entire bytes that will become a sequence of 1 s. Can you set this all at once?

5.8	What about the start and end of the line? Do you need to set those pixels individually, or can you set them all at once?

5.8	Does your code handle the case when xl and x2 are in the same byte?
