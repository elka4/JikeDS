Random Set: Write a method to randomly generate a set of mintegers from an array of size n. Each element must have equal probability of being chosen.
Hints: #494, #596

17.3	Try this recursively. Suppose you had an algorithm to get a subset of size m from n -1 elements. Could you develop an algorithm to get a subset of size m from n elements?

17.3	If you haven't already, solve 17.2 on page 186.
