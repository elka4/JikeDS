17.1	Walk through binary addition by hand (slowly!) and try to really understand what is happening.

17.1	The adding step alone would convert 1 + 1 -> 0,1 + 0-> 1,0 + 1 -> 1,0 + 0->0. How do you do this without the + sign?times your recursive algorithm needs to return the start of the linked list, and some¬times it needs to return the end. There are multiple ways of solving this issue. Brainstorm some of them.
17.1	The carry will happen when you are doing 1 + 1. How do you apply the carry to the number?


17.1 You can think about binary addition as iterating through the number, bit by bit, adding two bits, and then carrying over the one if necessary. You could also think about it as grouping the operations. What if you first added each of the bits (without carrying any overflow)? After that, you can handle the overflow.

17.1	Focus on just one of the steps above. If you “forgot" to carry the ones, what would the add operation look like?

17.1	You can do the add step with an XOR.

17.1	Now focus on the carrying. In what cases will values carry? How do you apply the carry to the number?
17.1	You can use an AND operation to compute the carry. What do you do with it?
17.1	You might need to do the add/carry operation more than once. Adding carry to sum might cause new values to carry.
