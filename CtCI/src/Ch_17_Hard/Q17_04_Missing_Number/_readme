Missing Number: An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one number which is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in A with a single operation. The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is "fetch t h e j t h b i t o f A [ i ] ," w h i c h t a k e s c o n s t a n t t i m e . W r i t e c o d e t o f i n d t h e m i s s i n g i n t e g e r . C a n y o u d o itinO(n) time?

17.4	How long would it take you to figure out the least significant bit of the missing number?
17.4	To find the least significant bit of the missing number, note that you know how many 0s and Is to expect. For example, if you see three 0s and three Is in the least significant bit, then the missing number's least significant bit must be a 1. Think about it: in any sequence of 0s and Is, you'd get a 0, then a 1, then a 0, then a 1, and so on.
17.4	Once you've identified that the least significant bit is a 0 (or a 1), you can rule out all the numbers without 0 as the least significant bit. How is this problem different from the earlier part?
