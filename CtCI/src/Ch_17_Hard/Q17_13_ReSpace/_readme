Re-Space: Oh, no! You have accidentally removed all spaces, punctuation, and capitalization in a lengthy document. A sentence Iike"I reset the computer. It s till didn't boot!" became"iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot': You'll deal with the punctuation and capi- talization later; right now you need to re-insert the spaces. Most of the words are in a dictionary but a few are not. Given a dictionary (a list of strings) and the document (a string)' design an algorithm to unconcatenate the document in a way that minimizes the number of unrecognized characters.
EXAMPLE:
Input jesslookedjustliketimherbrother
Output: jess looked just like tim her brother (7 unrecognized characters) Hints: #496, #623, #656, #677, #739, #749
