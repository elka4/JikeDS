Re-Space: Oh, no! You have accidentally removed all spaces, punctuation, and capitalization in a lengthy document. A sentence Iike"I reset the computer. It s till didn't boot!" became"iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot': You'll deal with the punctuation and capi- talization later; right now you need to re-insert the spaces. Most of the words are in a dictionary but a few are not. Given a dictionary (a list of strings) and the document (a string)' design an algorithm to unconcatenate the document in a way that minimizes the number of unrecognized characters.
EXAMPLE:
Input jesslookedjustliketimherbrother
Output: jess looked just like tim her brother (7 unrecognized characters)

Hints: #496, #623, #656, #677, #739, #749

17.13	Try a recursive approach.
17.13	Can you just try all possibilities? What might that look like?
17.13	You can think about the choices the recursive algorithm makes in one of two ways: (1) At each character, should I put a space here? (2) Where should I put the next space? You can solve both of these recursively.
17.13	Will the recursive algorithm hit the same subproblems repeatedly? Can you optimize with a hash table?
17.13	In real life, we would know that some paths will not lead to a word. For example, there are no words that start with hel lot his ism. Can we terminate early when going down a path that we know won't work?â€ƒ
17.13	For early termination, try a trie.
