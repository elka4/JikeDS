9.2	Social Network: How would you design the data structures for a very large social network like Face- book or Linkedln? Describe how you would design an algorithm to show the shortest path between two people (e.g.. Me -> Bob -> Susan -> Jason -> You).
Hints: #270, #285, #304, #321


9.2	To find the connection between two nodes, would it be better to do a breadth-first search or depth-first search? Why?
9.2	A breadth-first search is probably better. A depth-first search can wind up going on a long path, even though the shortest path is actually very short. Is there a modification to a breadth-first search that might be even faster?
9.2	Is there any way to search from both the source and destination? For what reason or in what case might this be faster?
9.2	Discuss how you might implement these algorithms and this system in the real world. What sort of optimizations might you make?
