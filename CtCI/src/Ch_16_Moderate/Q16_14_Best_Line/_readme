number of points.


Hints: #491, #520, #529, #563

16.14	Sometimes, a brute force is a pretty good solution. Can you try all possible lines?

16.14	You can't truly try all possible lines in the world—that's infinite. But you know that a "best" line must intersect at least two points. Can you connect each pair of points? Can you check if each line is indeed the best line?

16.14	You should be able to get to an 0(N2) solution.

16.14	Have you tried using a hash table?
