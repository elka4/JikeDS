Rand7 from RandS: Implement a method rand7() given rand5 (). That is, given a method that generates a random number between 0 and 4 (inclusive), write a method that generates a random number between 0 and 6 (inclusive).

16.23	8e very careful that your solution actually returns each value from 0 through 6 with equal probability.
16.23	Start with a brute force solution. How many times does it call rand5() in the worst case?
16.23	Make a table indicating how each possible sequence of calls to rand5() would map to the result of rand7(). For example, if you were implementing rand3() with (rand2() + rand2()) % 3, then the table would look like the below. Analyze this table. What can it tell you?
16.23	Looking at this table again, note that the number of rows will be 5\ where k is the max number of calls to rand5(). In order to make each value between 0 and 6 have equal probability, Yi th of the rows must map to 0, x/t th to 1, and so on. Is this possible?
16.23	It is not possible to divide 5k evenly by 7. Does this mean that you can't implement rand7() with rand5()?
16.23	You can implement rand7() with rand5(), you just can't do it deterministically (such that you know it will definitely terminate after a certain number of calls). Given this, write a solution that works.
