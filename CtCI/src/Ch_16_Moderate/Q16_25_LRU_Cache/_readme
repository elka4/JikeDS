LRU Cache: Design and build a "least recently used" cache, which evicts the least recently used item. The cache should map from keys to values (allowing you to insert and retrieve a value associ- ated with a particular key) and be initialized with a max size. When it is full, it should evict the least recently used item.

16.25	First scope the problem. What are the features you would want?
16.25	What data structure would be most useful for the lookups? What data structure would be most useful to know and maintain the order of items?
16.25	Both a hash table and a doubly linked list would be useful. Can you combine the two?
