16.2	Word Frequencies: Design a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in a book. What if we were running this algorithm multiple times?

Hints: #489, #536



16.2	Think about what the best conceivable runtime is for this problem. If your solution matches the best conceivable runtime, then you probably canâ€™t do any better.

16.2 Can you use a hash table to optimize the repeated case?
