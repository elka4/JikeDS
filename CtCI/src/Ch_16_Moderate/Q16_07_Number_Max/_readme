16.7	Number Max: Write a method that finds the maximum of two numbers. You should not use if-else or any other comparison operator.

Hints: #473, #513, #707, #728


16.7	Have you considered how to handle integer overflow in a - b?

16.7	Let k be 1 if a > b and 0 otherwise. If you were given k, could you return the max (without a comparison or if-else logic)?

16.7	If k were 1 when a > b and 0 otherwise, then you could return a*k + b*(not k). But how do you create k?

16.7	When a > b, then a - b > 0. Can you get the sign bit of a - b?
