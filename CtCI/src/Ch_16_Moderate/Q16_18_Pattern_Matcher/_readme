Pattern Matching:You are given two strings, pattern and value.The pattern string consists ofjust thele t t e r s a a n d b, d e s c r i b i n g a p a t t e r n w i t h i n a s t r i n g .
For e x a m p l e , the string catcatgocatgo
matches the pattern aabab (where cat is a and go is b). It also matches patterns like a, ab, and b.
Write a method to determine if value matches pattern .

16.18	Start with a brute force approach. Can you try all possibilities for a and b?

16.18	Observe that one of the substrings, either a or b, must start at the beginning of the string. That cuts down the number of possibilities.

16.18	Don't forget to handle the possibility that the first character in the pattern is b.

16.18	Be careful with how you analyze the runtime. If you iterate through 0(n2) substrings and each one does an 0(n) string comparison, then the total runtime is 0(n3).

16.18	Suppose you decide on a specific value for the "a" part of a pattern. How many possibiliÂ¬ties are there for b?

16.18	Since the value of a determines the value of b (and vice versa) and either a or b must start at the beginning of the value, you should have only 0(n) possibilities for how to split up the pattern.

16.18	You should be able to have an 0(n3) algorithm.
