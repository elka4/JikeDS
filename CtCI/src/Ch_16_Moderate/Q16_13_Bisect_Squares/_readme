Bisect Squares: Given two squares on a two-dimensional plane, find a line that would cut these two squares in half. Assume that the top and the bottom sides of the square run parallel to the x-axis.

Hints: #468, #479, #528, #560

16.13	Draw a square and a bunch of lines that cut it in half. Where are those lines located?

16.13	Any straight line that cuts a square in half goes through the center of the square. How then can you find a line that cuts two squares in half?

16.13	To cut two squares in half, a line must go through the middle of both squares.

16.13	Given a line (slope and y-intercept), can you find where it intersects another line?
