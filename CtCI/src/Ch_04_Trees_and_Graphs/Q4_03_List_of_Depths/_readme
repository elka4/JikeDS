4.3	List of Depths: Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, youâ€™ll have D linked lists).

Hints: #107, #123, #135



4.3	Try modifying a graph search algorithm to track the depth from the root.

4.3	A hash table or array that maps from level number to nodes at that level might also be useful.

4.3	You should be able to come up with an algorithm involving both depth-first search and breadth-first search.
