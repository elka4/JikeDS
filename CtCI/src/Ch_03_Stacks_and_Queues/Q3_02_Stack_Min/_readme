3.2	Stack Min: How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.
Hints: #27, #59, #78




3.2	Observe that the minimum element doesn't change very often. It only changes when a smaller element is added, or when the smallest element is popped.
3.2	What if we kept track of extra data at each stack node? What sort of data might make it easier to solve the problem?
3.2	Consider having each node know the minimum of its "substack" (all the elements beneath it, including itself).
