7.9	Circular Array: Implement a CircularAr ray class that supports an array-like data structure which can be efficiently rotated. If possible, the class should use a generic type (also called a template), and should support iteration via the standard for (Obj o : circularArray) notation.
Hints: #389


7.9	The rotate () method should be able to run in 0(1) time.There's no one right answer here. Discuss several different technical implementations.
