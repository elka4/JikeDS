2.6	Palindrome: Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.
Hints: #5, #13, #29, #61, #101

A palindrome is something which is the same when written forwards and backwards. What if you reversed the linked list?
2.6	Try using a stack.
2.6	Assume you have the length of the linked list. Can you implement this recursively?
2.6	In the recursive approach (we have the length of the list), the middle is the base case: isPermutation(middle) is true. The node x to the immediate left of the middle: What can that node do to check if x->middle->y forms a palindrome? Now suppose that checks out. What about the previous node a? If x- >middle- >y is a palindrome, how can it check that a->x->middle->y->b is a palindrome?
2.6	Go back to the previous hint. Remember:There are ways to return multiple values. You can do this with a new class.
