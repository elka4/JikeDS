8.5	Recursive Multiply: Write a recursive function to multiply two positive integers without using the * operator. You can use addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, but you should minimize the number of those operations.
Hints: # 166, #203, #227, #234, #246, #280


8.5	Think about how you might handle this for odd numbers.
8.5	If there's duplicated work across different recursive calls, can you cache it?
8.5	If you wanted to count the cells in an 8x9 matrix, you could count the cells in a 4x9 matrix and then double it.
8.5	Think about multiplying 8 by 9 as counting the number of cells in a matrix with width 8 and height 9.
8.5	Alternatively, if you're doing 9*7, you could do 4*7, double that, and then add 7.
