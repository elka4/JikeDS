Hints: #300, #324, #343, #380, #394


8.11	Try breaking it down into subproblems. If you were making change, what is the first choice you would make?
8.11	If you were making change, the first choice you might make is how many quarters you need to use.
8.11	Analyze your algorithm. Is there any repeated work? Can you optimize this?
8.11    Try using memoization.
8.11	Once you've decided to use two quarters to make change for 98 cents, you now need to figure out how many ways to make change for 48 cents using nickels, dimes, and pennies.
