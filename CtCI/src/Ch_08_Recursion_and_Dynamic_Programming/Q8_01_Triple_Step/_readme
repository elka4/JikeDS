8.1	Triple Step: A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.

Hints: #152, #178, #217, #237, #262, #359

8.1	Approach this from the top down. What is the very last hop the child made?

8.1	If we knew the number of paths to each of the steps before step 100, could we compute the number of steps to 100?

8.1	We multiply the values when it's "we do this then this." We add them when itâ€™s "we do this or this."

8.1	What is the runtime of this method? Think carefully. Can you optimize it?

8.1	Try memoization as a way to optimize an inefficient recursive program.
