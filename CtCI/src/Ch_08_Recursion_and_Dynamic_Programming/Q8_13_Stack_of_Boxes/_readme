8.13	Stack of Boxes: You have a stack of n boxes, with widths wt, heights hj, and depths drThe boxes cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of one another if each box in the stack is strictly larger than the box above it in width, height, and depth. Implement a method to compute the height of the tallest possible stack. The height of a stack is the sum of the heights of each box.

8.13 Will sorting the boxes help in any way?
8.13	We can sort the boxes by any dimension in descending order. This will give us a partial order for the boxes, in that boxes later in the array must appear before boxes earlier in the array.
8.13	Try to break it down into subproblems.
8.13	Think about the first decision you have to make. The first decision is which box will be at the bottom.
8.13	Once we pick the box on the bottom, we need to pick the second box. Then the third box.
8.13	Once you have a basic recursive algorithm implemented, think about if you can optiÂ¬mize it. Are there any repeated subproblems?
8.13	Alternatively, we can think about the repeated choices as: Does the first box go on the stack? Does the second box go on the stack? And so on.
