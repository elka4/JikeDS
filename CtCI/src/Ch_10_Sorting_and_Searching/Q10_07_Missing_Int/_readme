10.7	Missing Int: Given an input file with four billion non-negative integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer that is not contained in the file. Assume you have 1 GB of memory available for this task.

What if you have only 10 MB of memory? Assume that all the values are distinct and we now have no more than one billion non-negative integers.

Hints: #235, #254, #281

10.7	Would a bit vector help?
10.7	To do it with less memory, can you try multiple passes?
10.7	Try using one pass to get it down to a range of values, and then a second pass to find a specific value.
