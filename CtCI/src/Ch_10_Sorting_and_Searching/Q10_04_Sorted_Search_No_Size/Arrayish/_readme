10.4	Sorted Search, No Size: You are given an array-like data structure Listy which lacks a size method. It does, however, have an elementAt (i) method that returns the element at index i in 0(1) time. If i is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1. (For this reason, the data structure only supports positive integers.) Given a Listy which contains sorted, positive integers, find the index at which an element X occurs. If x occurs multiple times, you may return any index.

Hints: #320, #337, #348

10.4	Think about how binary search works. What will be the issue with just implementing binary search?
10.4	Binary search requires comparing an element to the midpoint. Getting the midpoint requires knowing the length. We don't know the length. Can we find it?
10.4	We can find the length by using an exponential backoff. First check index 2, then 4, then 8, then 16, and so on. What will be the runtime of this algorithm?
