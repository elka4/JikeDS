15.5	Call In Order: Suppose we have the following code: public class Foo {
public Foo() { ... } public void first() { ... } public void second () (...) public void third() (...)
)
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. ThreadA will call first, threadB will call second, and threadC will call third. Design a mechanism to ensure that first is called before second and second is called before third.


Hints: #417, #433, #446



15.5	Why would using boolean flags to do this be a bad idea?
15.5	Would semaphores be useful here?
15.5	How can we ensure that first () has terminated before calling second () ?
