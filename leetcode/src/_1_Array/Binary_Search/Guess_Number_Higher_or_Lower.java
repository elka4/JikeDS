LeetCode â€“ Guess Number Higher or Lower (Java)

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

-1 : My number is lower
1 : My number is higher
0 : Congrats! You got it!
Example:
n = 10, I pick 6.

Return 6.

    What we learn from this problem?

low+(high-low)/2 yields the same value with (low+high)/2. However, the first expression is less expensive. In addition, the following expression can be used:

low+((high-low)>>1)
(low+high)>>>1
Under the assumption that high and low are both non-negative, we know for sure that the upper-most bit (the sign-bit) is zero.

So both high and low are in fact 31-bit integers.

high = 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 = 1073741824
low  = 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 = 1073741824
When you add them together they may "spill" over into the top-bit.

high + low =       1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
           =  2147483648 as unsigned 32-bit integer
           = -2147483648 as signed   32-bit integer

(high + low) / 2   = 1100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 = -1073741824
(high + low) >>> 1 = 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 = 1073741824
