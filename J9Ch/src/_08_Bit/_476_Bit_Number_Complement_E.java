    The flipped version of the original input but

    For example input = 5 (the binary representation is 101), the LEFTMOST bit of 1 is the third one from RIGHTMOST (100, N = 3). Then we need to flip 3 bits from RIGHTMOST and the answer is 010
    To achieve above algorithm, we need to do 3 steps:

    Create a bit mask which has N bits of 1 from RIGHTMOST. In above example, the mask is 111. And we can use the decent Java built-in function Integer.highestOneBit to get the LEFTMOST bit of 1, left shift one, and then minus one. Please remember this wonderful trick to create bit masks with N ones at RIGHTMOST, you will be able to use it later.
    Negate the whole input number.

            for example:
            100110, its complement is 011001, the sum is 111111. So we only need get the min number large or equal to num, then do substraction

    To find complement of num = 5 which is 101 in binary.
    First ~num gives ...11111010 but we only care about the rightmost 3 bits.
    Then to erase the 1s before 010 we can add 1000*/

/*
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
Example 2:
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
