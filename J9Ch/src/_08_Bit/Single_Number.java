Leetcode â€“ Single Number (Java)

The problem:

Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

public class Single_Number {
   /* The key to solve this problem is bit manipulation. XOR will return 1 only on two different bits. So if two numbers are the same, XOR will return 0. Finally only one number left.*/

        int x = 0;
