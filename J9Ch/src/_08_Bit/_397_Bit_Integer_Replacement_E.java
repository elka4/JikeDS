    I really think it should be tagged medium because there are many subtleties and good understanding of binary arithmetic is required.

    The first step towards solution is to realize that you're allowed to remove the LSB only if it's zero. And to reach the target as fast as possible, removing digits is the best way to go. Hence, even numbers are better than odd. This is quite obvious.

    What is not so obvious is what to do with odd numbers. One may think that you just need to remove as many 1's as possible to increase the evenness of the number. Wrong! Look at this example:

            111011 -> 111010 -> 11101 -> 11100 -> 1110 -> 111 -> 1000 -> 100 -> 10 -> 1
    And yet, this is not the best way because

111011 -> 111100 -> 11110 -> 1111 -> 10000 -> 1000 -> 100 -> 10 -> 1
    See? Both 111011 -> 111010 and 111011 -> 111100 remove the same number of 1's, but the second way is better.

    So, we just need to remove as many 1's as possible, doing +1 in case of a tie? Not quite. The infamous test with n=3 fails for that strategy because 11 -> 10 -> 1 is better than 11 -> 100 -> 10 -> 1. Fortunately, that's the only exception (or at least I can't think of any other, and there are none in the tests).

            So the logic is:

            If n is even, halve it.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            If n=3 or n-1 has less 1's than n+1, decrement n.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Otherwise, increment n.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Here is an example of such a solution in Java:

/*    Of course, doing bitCount on every iteration is not the best way. It is enough to examine the last two digits to figure out whether incrementing or decrementing will give more 1's. Indeed, if a number ends with 01, then certainly decrementing is the way to go. Otherwise, if it ends with 11, then certainly incrementing is at least as good as decrementing (*011 -> *010 / *100) or even better (if there are three or more 1's). This leads to the following solution:*/

    When n is even, the operation is fixed. The procedure is unknown when it is odd. When n is odd it can be written into the form n = 2k+1 (k is a non-negative integer.). That is, n+1 = 2k+2 and n-1 = 2k. Then, (n+1)/2 = k+1 and (n-1)/2 = k. So one of (n+1)/2 and (n-1)/2 is even, the other is odd. And the "best" case of this problem is to divide as much as possible. Because of that, always pick n+1 or n-1 based on if it can be divided by 4. The only special case of that is when n=3 you would like to pick n-1 rather than n+1.

    public int integerReplacement3(int n) {
        if (n == Integer.MAX_VALUE) return 32; //n = 2^31-1;
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 1){
            if (n % 2 == 0) n  /= 2;
            else{
                if ( (n + 1) % 4 == 0 && (n - 1 != 2) ) n++;
                else n--;
            }

/*    JAVA 3ms Bit Manipulation Solution

    For this problem, if we look at the binary form of each number, we can get the idea that for each '1' (except for the first '1') it counts to two steps, for each '0', it counts to one step.
    So our goal is to use +1 or -1 to reduce steps.

            For example,
13 = 1101
    If we plus one, we can get 1110; if we reduce one, we can get 1100;
1110 needs 2+2+1 = 5 steps, while 1100 only needs 2+1+1 = 4 steps, so we choose n-1 in this step.

            Use long to avoid overflow (if n is Integer.MAX_VALUE).*/
