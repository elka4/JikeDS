LeetCode â€“ Palindrome Number (Java)

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

Thoughts

Problems related with numbers are frequently solved by / and %. No need of extra space is required. This problem is similar with the Reverse Integer problem.

Note: no extra space here means do not convert the integer to string, since string will be a copy of the integer and take extra space. The space take by div, left, and right can be ignored.
