LeetCode – Balanced Binary Tree (Java)

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Analysis

This is a typical tree problem that can be solve by using recursion.
