##Consider First

###Ask Questions
- what are the data types
- How much data is there?
- Do we have time complexity or space complexity requirement
- What does the array hold? Numbers? Characters? Strings?
- Are these integers all positive?
- are there any duplicates?
- is the array sorted first?
- What's our return / return type?

###Think first
- would the input cause overflow? so that I shall use long instead of integers?
- would the input be invalid?

###Think
- let me brainstorm the algorithm to handle this

###Design the algorithm
- what's the time and space time complexity?
- what happens if there is a lot of data
- Does the design cause other issues?
- If there are other limitations, did you make the right trade-off
-

####Test
- 0, negative, null, maximums, minimums
- use error: what happends if the user passes in null or negative value
- then test the normal case
