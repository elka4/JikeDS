"""
STATEMENT
Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.
The update(i, val) function modifies nums by updating the element at index i to val.

CLARIFICATIONS
- Are these two the only functions available to access/modify the array? Yes.
- How many times would the update and finding sum be called? They can be called the same number of times.
- Is the list sorted? Not necessarily.

EXAMPLES
[1, 3, 5]
sumRange(0, 2) -> 9
update(1, 2)
sumRange(0, 2) -> 8

COMMENTS
- The usual array has constant time update but O(n) to find the sum.
- We can store another array to indicate the sum till i-th point, then the time complexity
  to update would be linear, but finding sum would be constant. We'd need additional O(n)
  space complexity array.
- We can use binary index tree to do both the operations in O(log n). We'd need additional
  O(n) array, though.
